# Scanning and Enumeration

   The initial objectives and requirements forperforming scanning and enumeration in support of a penetration test or vulnera-bility assessment. This includes discussing the final phase of reconnaissance,vitality. After that, we will dig into some scenarios in which you will see how youcan use these different tools and techniques to their full advantage. Last, weâ€™ll doa hands-on challenge so you can test your new (or refined) skills in a real-world scenario.
  
   In a penetration test, there are implied boundaries. Depending on the breadth andscope of your testing, you may be limited to testing a certain number or specific typeof host, or you may be free to test anything your client owns or operates.

   For this purpose also our main tool used would be nmap. Refer to the cheat-sheet provided in previous phase.
  
# Usage
  
  nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] Target(s)
  [Scan Type] is the type of scan to perform. Different scan options are available and are discussed here :
  
  [Options] include a wide variety of configuration options including DNS resolution, use oftraceroutes, and more. Target is the target specification which can be a single host, a list of host names or IPs,or a full network.
  
  **Example** <br>
  root@HARM:~/nmap_scans# nmap -sn --send-ip 192.168.1.0/24 -oA
  
  nmap-sweep
  
  Starting Nmap nmap-7.80-1 at 2020-09-29 16:17 IST
  
  Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
  
  Host is up.
  
  Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.100
  
  Host is up (0.061s latency).
  
  MAC Address: 00:0C:29:XX:XX:XX (VMware)
  
  Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.110
  
  Host is up (0.0047s latency).
  
  MAC Address: 00:0C:29:XX:XX:XX (VMware)
  
  Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (3 hosts up) scanned in 89.75seconds
  
  
  The above shown is the example of using nmap on a host this was carried out in terminal of my linux device and also it has detected the virtual system present mac addresses of the system are cencersored as this is only for educational purpose.So guys now practice this on your own systems and move a step ahead in this field i also suggest you to refer the cheat sheet for nmap as this is an these two phases are very important and always keep record of the information collected in these phases even a single vulnerable port can lead to a huge impact on asset.
