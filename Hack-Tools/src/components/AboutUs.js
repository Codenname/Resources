				HackTools, is a web extension facilitating your web application penetration tests, it includes cheat
				sheets as well as all the tools used during a test such as XSS payloads, Reverse shells and much more.
				With the extension you no longer need to search for payloads in different websites or in your local
				storage space, most of the tools are accessible in one click. HackTools is accessible either in pop up
				mode or in a whole tab in the Devtools part of the browser with F12.
